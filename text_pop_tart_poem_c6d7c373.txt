Ode to a Pop Tart, crispy and sweet,
A breakfast delight, a tasty treat.
Strawberry jam, or chocolate divine,
Each flavor I try, I'm glad to call mine.

A toaster's embrace, a moment of heat,
My Pop Tart emerges, all golden and neat.
With frosting aglow, a sight to behold,
It warms my heart, and never gets old.

I take a small bite, the taste so surreal,
A fusion of flavors, a magical ordeal.
As crumbs disappear, my joy only grows,
For in every Pop Tart, true happiness shows.
