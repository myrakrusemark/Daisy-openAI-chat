1. Norovirus Link to Crohn's Disease May Point to New Therapies (https://nyulangone.org/news/norovirus-link-crohns-disease-may-point-new-therapies) - A new study suggests API5 (apoptosis inhibitor 5) as a potential target for treating Crohn's disease. Norovirus infection was found to block T cell secretion of API5 in mice bred to have a rodent form of Crohn's disease, killing gut lining cells in the process.

2. The Latest Research on Crohn's Disease (https://www.webmd.com/ibd-crohns-disease/crohns-disease/latest-crohns-research) - Researchers are looking at new drugs, especially anti-inflammatory biologics, to treat Crohn's disease. Some drugs focus on T-cells, while others stimulate natural immunity or use prebiotics to change gut bacteria. Additionally, researchers found that creeping fat in the intestines is linked to bacteria called Clostridium innocuum, which could become a target for future therapies.
