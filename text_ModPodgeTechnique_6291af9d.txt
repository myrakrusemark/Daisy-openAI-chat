The Mod Podge technique for creating rock-hard crochet pieces involves mixing Mod Podge and acrylic paint and applying it to the crochet piece. Once dry, it creates a hard and durable finish. To use this technique, mix equal parts Mod Podge and acrylic paint, apply the mixture to the crochet piece, and let it dry completely. Repeat the process until the desired hardness is achieved. This technique is great for creating bowls, coasters, and other home decor items.
